# Spell Checker
# Project Description 
This program provide real time feedback on spelling of typed words, sentences or phrases provide by the user and highlights the potential mistakes in red. 
This was built with the Tkinter module which provides a Graphical User Interface(GUI), as well as the Natural Language Processing Toolkit(nltk) module to provide the words data set. This contains over 236,000 words that can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval. For this program information retrieval was the main use for this data set.

# The next step?
In the future I aim to add spelling suggestions or autocorrect using natural language processing and more advanced machine learning technqiues e.g. Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN's)
